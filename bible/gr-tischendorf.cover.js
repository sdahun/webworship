	comments: "<p> Tischendorf's 8th edition Greek New Testament</p><p> with morphological tags</p><p> Version 1.4</p><p> Based on G. Clint Yale's Tischendorf text</p><p> and on Dr. Maurice A. Robinson's</p><p> Public Domain Westcott-Hort text</p><p> Edited by Ulrik Petersen</p><p> This text and its analysis are</p><p> in the Public Domain. Copy freely.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>============</p><p>The present work is Tischendorf's 8th edition of the Greek New</p><p>Testament, augmented with morphological tags, Strong's numbers, and</p><p>lemmas.</p><p>Even though I am designated as the editor, the bulk of the work in the</p><p>preparation of this text was done by two other men, namely G. Clint</p><p>Yale and Maurice A. Robinson. Thus they deserve most of the credit</p><p>for the existence of this work. Clint Yale provided the base</p><p>Tischendorf text, while Dr. Robinson provided a fully parsed and</p><p>lemmatized Westcott-Hort text (with some errors that were mutually</p><p>corrected in the preparation of this edition). I heartily thank them</p><p>both.</p><p>Preparation of the text</p><p>=======================</p><p>Clint Yale has published two Tischendorf texts. The first was</p><p>published in the Public Domain on the Internet in 1997, and only</p><p>contained the text -- without diacritics, punctuation, or apparatus.</p><p>Mr. Yale's second Tischendorf text was published later, and contained</p><p>both diacritics, punctuation, and Tischendorf's apparatus.</p><p>The basis of the present work was originally Mr. Yale's Public Domain</p><p>1997 Tischendorf text, since most of the analysis was carried out</p><p>using that text. However, during the last stages of preparation of</p><p>the text, Mr. Yale very graciously permitted me to distribute, in the</p><p>Public Domain, an accentuated version based on his later Tischendorf,</p><p>for which I am very grateful. The Greek NT community owes him a debt</p><p>of gratitude for this generosity.</p><p>The text has been corrected (though not thoroughly checked) against a</p><p>facsimile copy of Tischendorf. The text thus mostly conforms with the</p><p>printed Tischendorf. Even in cases of clear typographical errors, the</p><p>text has been retained as it was printed. As Mr. Yale notes in the</p><p>introduction to his later Tischendorf edition, the printed version was</p><p>\"typographically challenged\". Having dealt with the text in detail, I</p><p>can only confirm Mr. Yale's judgment on this account.</p><p>Preparation of the analysis</p><p>===========================</p><p>Westcott-Hort and Tischendorf's 8th edition share a large percentage</p><p>of common text. Therefore, the decision was made to base the</p><p>morphological analysis and lemmatization on Dr. Robinson's Public</p><p>Domain Westcott-Hort text.</p><p>A computer program was written to port over as much as possible of</p><p>Dr. Robinson's Westcott-Hort analysis, with manual analyses being</p><p>added where necessary. Only about 10740 words could not be ported</p><p>over directly. Of these, only about 900 words needed manual analyses,</p><p>while about another 300 word-forms were merely differences in</p><p>spelling. An analytical lexicon totalling about 290 word-forms was</p><p>developed for those forms which were peculiar to Tischendorf, or which</p><p>needed other special attention. For the rest, an analytical lexicon</p><p>was constructed automatically from the Westcott-Hort text, which was</p><p>then utilized in giving parses and Strong's numbers to forms which had</p><p>a unique analysis in that lexicon.</p><p>After the analysis was complete, numerous consistency-checks were made</p><p>on the analysis. Grammatical relations such as agreement were checked</p><p>using the linguistic search engine \"Emdros\", with subsequent manual</p><p>checking and correction of the cases where agreement had been broken</p><p>by the process of porting the tags over from the Westcott-Hort text.</p><p>After this, all instances of ambiguity in either the lemma or the</p><p>parsing of a word were checked, numbering about 1030. In checking</p><p>these instances, linguistic searches were again run in cases that were</p><p>not attributable to genuine morphological ambiguity. If it turned out</p><p>that there was a mistake, it was corrected, and the search was run</p><p>again to ensure that the error was gone. After that, searches were</p><p>run on all individual parts of speech (except verbs and nouns),</p><p>listing all unique forms, their Strong's number, and their lemma. The</p><p>surface forms were compared to the lemmas, and irregularities were</p><p>weeded out.</p><p>Whenever a word-form was found which seemed not to be correct Greek,</p><p>it was checked against the facsimile, and corrected if necessary.</p><p>Finally, all neuter nouns which were present either as nominative or</p><p>accusative, but not both, were carefully checked to ensure that the</p><p>correct case had been assigned.</p><p>Assignment of lemmas</p><p>====================</p><p>Two lemmas are provided: One conforms to Strong's dictionary, while</p><p>the other mostly conforms to Friberg, Friberg, and Miller's ANLEX.</p><p>ANLEX represents more than a century's worth of additional scholarship</p><p>compared to Strong's dictionary. This and other factors entail that</p><p>ANLEX has, in some respects, a more fine-grained lemma-division than</p><p>Strong's. </p><p>Now, the lemmas were added automatically, based solely on the assigned</p><p>Strong's number. Therefore, in a few cases, a distinction which ANLEX</p><p>makes is lost, since it was not made by Strong. One such example is</p><p>H)=XOS which in ANLEX is two lemmas, one being masculine and the other</p><p>being neuter. In Strong's dictionary, there is only one lemma, hence</p><p>only one number, and hence, since the lemmas are based on the Strong's</p><p>number, the distinction is lost.</p><p>The process was carried out with constant reference to a number of</p><p>grammars and lexica, including BDAG, Thayer, Strong's, Abbott-Smith,</p><p>Perschbacher, Liddell-Scott, and last, but not least, Friberg, Friberg</p><p>and Miller's ANLEX. Blass-Debrunner-Rehkopf and Blass-Debrunner-Funk</p><p>were consulted on occasion, as were a number of introductory grammars.</p><p>During the process described above, the editor had much pleasant</p><p>interaction both with Professor Robinson and with Mr. Yale, resulting</p><p>in mutual correction of our respective databases. All remaining</p><p>errors are, of course, my own responsibility.</p><p>Feedback</p><p>========</p><p>The editor welcomes feedback and suggestions for improvement.
