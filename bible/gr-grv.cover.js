Those words with no tag are do not differ in the various printings of the Greek.</p><p><strong>τ = Stephens 1550 Textus Receptus.</strong></p><p>The text used is George Ricker Berry's edition of \"The Interlinear Literal Translation of the Greek New Testament.\" This text is virtually identical to Erasmus 1516, Beza 1598, and the actual Textus Receptus: Elzevir 1633. Berry states that \"In the main they are one and the same; and [any] of them may be referred to as the Textus Receptus\" (Berry, p.ii). </p><p>These early printed Greek New Testaments closely parallel the text of the English King James Authorized Version of 1611, since that version was based closely upon Beza 1598, which differed little from its \"Textus Receptus\" predecessors. These Textus Receptus editions follow the Byzantine Majority mss., which was predominant during the period of manual copying of Greek New Testament manuscripts.</p><p><strong>σ = Scrivener 1894 Textus Receptus</strong></p><p>The text used is \"Καινή Διαθήκη: The New Testament. The Greek Text underlying the English Authorised Version of 1611\" (London: Trinitarian Bible Society, 1977). This is an unchanged reprint of Scrivener's \"The New Testament in the Original Greek according to the Text followed in the Authorised Version\" (Cambridge: University Press, 1894, 1902). </p><p>Scrivener attempted to reconstruct the Greek text underlying the English 1611 KJ for comparison to the 1881 English R.V. In those places where the KJ followed the Latin Vulgate (Joh 10:16), Scrivener inserted the greek reading, as opposed to back-translating the Latin to Greek--which would have produced a Greek word with no Greek mss. evidence. Scrivner's work follows the Byzantine Majority texts, and in many places matches the modern Alexandrian based editions.</p><p><strong>β= Byzantine Majority</strong></p><p>The text is that identified by Freiherr Von Soden, \"Die Schriften des Neuen Testaments in ihrer altesten erreichbaren Textgestalt\" (Gottingen: Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht, 1911) and Herman C. Hoskier, \"Concerning the Text of the Apocalypse\" (London: Bernard Quaritch, 1929). This technique of Byzantine identification and weighting, was utilized by Hodges and Farsted in \"The Greek New Testament according to the Majority Text\" (Nashville: Thomas Nelson, 1982; 1985). It was subsequently utilized by Robinson and Pierpont, resulting in 99.75 percent agreement between the two texts. </p><p>The Byzantine Majority text is closely identified with the Textus Receptus editions, and well it should with greater than 98% agreement. As Maurice Robinson pointed out in his edition of the Byzantine Majority: \"George Ricker Berry correctly noted that 'in the main they are one and the same; and [any] of them may be referred to as the Textus Receptus' (George Ricker Berry, ed., _The Interlinear Literal Translation of the Greek New Testament_ [New York: Hinds & Noble, 1897], p.ii).</p><p><strong>α= Alexandrian</strong></p><p>The differences are those identified by United Bible Society 3rd ed., and utilized by modern translations such as NI and NAS. While these variants come from mss. with less textual evidence than the Byzantine Majority, many of the differences are exactly the same as those identified by the Byzantine Majority and Scrivner. The percentage of variants are quite small and occur mainly in word placement, and spelling. Many of the variations identified are omitted or bracketed words, which is not surprising due to a significantly smaller base of text from this stream of transmission.</p><p>This theWord module was created by Rúbio R.
