These books tell us how we can be saved from the evil of this world and gain eternal life that is truly worth living. Although the Holy Bible contains rules of conduct, it is not just a rule book. It reveals God’s heart—a Father’s heart, full of love and compassion. The Holy Bible tells you what you need to know and believe to be saved from sin and evil and how to live a life that is truly worth living, no matter what your current circumstances may be.\n</div>\n<div class=\"p\">The Holy Bible consists of two main sections: the Old Testament (including Psalms and Proverbs) and the New Testament (Matthew through Revelation). The Old Testament records God’s interaction with mankind before He sent His son to redeem us, while recording prophesy predicting that coming. The New Testament tells us of God’s Son and Anointed One, Jesus, and the wonderful salvation that He purchased for us.\n</div>\n<div class=\"p\">The same Holy Spirit who inspired the Holy Bible is living among us today, and He is happy to help you understand what He intended as you study His Word. Just ask Him, and He is more than happy to help you apply His message to your life.\n</div>\n<div class=\"p\">The Old Testament was originally written mostly in Hebrew. The New Testament was originally written mostly in the common street Greek (not the formal Greek used for official legal matters). The Holy Bible is translated into many languages, and being translated into many more, so that everyone may have an opportunity to hear the Good News about Jesus Christ.\n</div>\n<div class=\"s\">Why was the World English Bible translated?\n\n<a name=\"C1V2\"></a></div>\n<div class=\"p\">There are already many good translations of the Holy Bible into contemporary English. Unfortunately, almost all of them are restricted by copyright and copyright holder policy. This restricts publication and republication of God’s Word in many ways, such as in downloadable files on the Internet, use of extensive quotations in books, etc. The World English Bible was commissioned by God in response to prayer about this subject.\n</div>\n<div class=\"p\">Because the World English Bible is in the Public Domain (not copyrighted), it can be freely copied, distributed, and redistributed without any payment of royalties. You don’t even have to ask permission to do so. You may publish the whole World English Bible in book form, bind it in leather and sell it. You may incorporate it into your Bible study software. You may make and distribute audio recordings of it. You may broadcast it. All you have to do is maintain the integrity of God’s Word before God, and reserve the name “World English Bible” for faithful copies of this translation.\n</div>\n<div class=\"s\">How was the World English Bible translated?\n\n<a name=\"C1V3\"></a></div>\n<div class=\"p\">The World English Bible is an update of the American Standard Version (ASV) of the Holy Bible, published in 1901. A custom computer program updated the archaic words and word forms to contemporary equivalents, and then a team of volunteers proofread and updated the grammar. The New Testament was updated to conform to the Majority Text reconstruction of the original Greek manuscripts, thus taking advantage of the superior access to manuscripts that we have now compared to when the original ASV was translated.\n</div>\n<div class=\"s\">What is different about the World English Bible?\n\n<a name=\"C1V4\"></a></div>\n<div class=\"p\">The style of the World English Bible, while fairly literally translated, is in informal, spoken English. The World English Bible is designed to sound good and be accurate when read aloud. It is not formal in its language, just as the original Greek of the New Testament was not formal. The WEB uses contractions rather freely.\n</div>\n<div class=\"p\">The World English Bible doesn’t capitalize pronouns pertaining to God. The original manuscripts made no such distinction. Hebrew has no such thing as upper and lower case, and the original Greek manuscripts were written in all upper case letters. Attempting to add in such a distinction raises some difficulties in translating dual-meaning Scriptures such as the coronation psalms.\n</div>\n<div class=\"p\">The World English Bible main edition translates God’s Proper Name in the Old Testament as “Yahweh.” The Messianic Edition and the British Edition of the World English Bible translates the same name as “LORD” (all capital letters), or when used with “Lord” (mixed case, translated from “Adonai”,) GOD. There are solid translational arguments for both traditions.\n</div>\n<div class=\"p\">Because World English Bible uses the Majority Text as the basis for the New Testament, you may notice the following differences in comparing the WEB to other translations:\n</div>\n<div class=\"li\">The order of Matthew 23:13 and 14 is reversed in some translations.\n</div>\n<div class=\"li\">Luke 17:36 and Acts 15:34, which are not found in the majority of the Greek Manuscripts (and are relegated to footnotes in the WEB) may be included in some other translations.\n</div>\n<div class=\"li\">Romans 14:24-26 in the WEB may appear as Romans 16:25-27 in other translations.\n</div>\n<div class=\"li\">1 John 5:7-8 contains an addition in some translations, including the KJV. Erasmus admitted adding this text to his published Greek New Testament, even though he could at first find no Greek manuscript support for it, because he was being pressured by men to do so, and because he didn’t see any doctrinal harm in it. Lots of things not written by John in this letter are true, but we decline to add them to what the Holy Spirit inspired through John.\n</div>\n<div class=\"p\">With all of the above and some other places where lack of clarity in the original manuscripts has led to multiple possible readings, significant variants are listed in footnotes. The reading that in our prayerful judgment is best is in the main text. Overall, the World English Bible isn’t very much different than several other good contemporary English translations of the Holy Bible. The message of Salvation through Jesus Christ is still the same. The point of this translation was not to be very different (except for legal status), but to update the ASV for readability while retaining or improving the accuracy of that well-respected translation and retaining the public domain status of the ASV.\n</div>\n<div class='s'>What are MT, TR, and NU? </div>\n<div class='p'>In the footnotes, MT refers to the Greek Majority Text New Testament, which is the authoritative basis for this translation. TR stands for Textus Receptus, which is the Greek Text from which the King James Version New Testament was translated. NU stands for the Nestle-Aland/UBS critical text of the Greek New Testament, which is used as a basis for some other Bible translations. </div>\n\n<div class=\"s\">More Information\n\n<a name=\"C1V5\"></a></div>\n<div class=\"p\">For answers to frequently asked questions about the World English Bible, please visit <a href='http://WorldEnglishBible.org'>WorldEnglishBible.org</a>.\n</div>\n<div class=\"pageFooter\">\n<hr>\n</div></div>\n\n<h1>The World English Bible</h1>\n\n<p>The World English Bible is in the Public Domain.

All we ask is that if you CHANGE the actual text of the World English Bible in any way, other than changing from American to British spelling or vice versa, you not call the result the World English Bible any more. This is to avoid confusion, not to limit your freedom. The Holy Bible is God's Word. It belongs to God. He gave it to us freely, and we who have worked on this translation freely give it to you by dedicating it to the Public Domain.</p>\n\n<p>Donations to help with the expenses of this project and thus help others have free access to the Word of God may be made to us, but are not required.

All Old Testament and New Testament books are essentially done, but well-justified typo reports and translation suggestions will still be considered. Editing work continues on the companion Apocrypha/Deuterocanon/Psuedepigrapha books, mostly in the form of slight updates to language and punctuation, but the meaning should be correct as those books read now. In the companion Apocrypha/Deuterocanon of the World English Bible, Tobit, Judith, Esther (Greek), Psalm 151, Daniel (Greek), and Wisdom are essentially done. The rest of the Apocrypha/Deuterocanon/Pseudepigrapha books are an automated update of those books from the <a href=\"http://eBible.org/eng-rv/\">Revised Version</a> or copied from the <a href=\"http://eBible.org/eng-lxx2012/\">LXX2012: Septuagint in English 2012</a>, depending on the book. These should be at least as accurate as the source translations, but not as polished in modern English usage\nas the rest of the World English Bible. New updates will be posted on <a href=\"http://eBible.org/web/\">http://eBible.org/web/</a> and at <a href=\"http://WorldEnglishBible.org\">http://WorldEnglishBible.org</a>.</p>\n",
